Type "make" to compile the binaries.

Then run the "extract.pl" script in the following manner:

  $ cat parse_trees | extract.pl > features 2> feature_map

"features" will contain all featureid:value pairs for each input parse
tree, and "feature_map" records the mapping between feature id and
name.
