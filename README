This directory contains code for extracting features from the data files
in ../data, for use with various estimation programs.

Usage:

extract-features train.trees.bz2 dev.trees.bz2 train.fc.bz2 dev.fc.bz2

where:
 train.trees.bz2 and dev.trees.bz2 are the training/development trees,
 train.fc.bz2 and dev.fc.bz2 are the training/development feature count files.

The features are written to standard output.
